Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments.

      "Job_Description": "Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.The company is founder led, profitable and growing.We have created a new career path at Canonical for Performance Engineers who bring exceptional clarity to software performance, correctness and efficiency. We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.As an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act as drivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus 'percorr' because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously 'dark' aspects of their work.We also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.If they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to be truly exceptional individuals, and also leaders who are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs. There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.This is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists. Whether you have a particular language focus - C, C++, Rust, Golang, Python, Java, Flutter-Dart or others - or a particular love of the kernel or hardware or CPU instruction set, whether you see yourself as driving perceived user experience through performance or optimising the efficiency of data centers to reduce carbon footprint, this process is the best way to find a role at Canonical that speaks to your precision, rigour, insight and drive.Location: We have teams in every time zone, and can accommodate applications from almost any country.Nice-to-have skills we valueLow-level CPU insights and assembly language - understanding cache, registers, vectorization, memoryKernel performance insights - scheduling, context switching, hardware accelerationDistributed systems performance insights - tracing, debuggingCompiler level performance insights - profile guided optimization, inlining, assemblerRuntime performance insights - Golang, Python, JVM, NodeJSDatabase performance evaluation - plans, indexing, data modelling, tracing, monitoringWeb browser performance insights - JS, web frameworks, tracing, CSSPerformance measurement tooling - profiling, eBPF, D-Trace, flamegraphsBenchmarks and performance measurement tools - Phoronix Test Suite, othersTest harnesses and capabilities in C, C++, Rust, Python, Golang, NodeJS, JavaScriptThe role entailsDrive software performance and correctness in a specific projectCollaborate with colleagues and community around the globeWork on shared tools and infrastructure for performance measurement, analysis and reportingTeach, train and develop skills in your team for performance culture and designStrengthen test capabilities, harnesses and pipelinesAnalyze systems and code to understand performance and scalabilitySolve problems directly or through influence, leadership and skills developmentReview code and technical designsWhat we are looking for in youExceptional academic track record from both high school and universityUndergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or PhysicsDemonstrable personal initiatives to measure and improve performance, efficiency and correctness in codeConfidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitationTrack record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding resultsLeadership and commitment to skills development and mentorshipPassion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiativesThe work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleaguesProfessional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skillsExperience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountabilityAppreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisationThoughtfulness and self-motivation Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks longWhat we offer colleaguesWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundDiversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and inspiring stories.UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.Lebanon is still going through one of the worst economic crises in its modern history. Since October 2019, the economy has shrunk by more than 39.9%, with GDP dropping from US$54.9 billion in 2018 to an estimated US$23 billion in 2022. This has led to a significant decrease in GDP per capita, falling from $9,225 in 2018 to an estimated $3,303 in 2022 [1] .The brutal economic collapse has had severe social and humanitarian consequences, disproportionally affecting vulnerable groups especially women and youth. Vulnerable groups including women, youth among others have been bearing the brunt of the crisis: women unemployment rates reached as high as 32% [2] , exacerbating the existing gender gap.UNDP Lebanon is implementing a comprehensive approach that would foster women equal access to resources, tools and economic opportunities (markets) that would enable them to do business better, while making sure that institutions (public and private) are more responsive to women’s needs and are able to provide them with the needed tools, systems and opportunities to be the main drivers of their economic success and empowerment.

      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundMore than 60 percent of the Arab region’s population is under the age of 30. Harnessing the energy of youth has the potential to build peace and stability and expand economic opportunities for them and their countries. However, unlocking these possibilities for young people requires partnership among all stakeholders, including youth themselves as well as a whole-of-society approach that widens participation and inclusion of youth in all aspects of life. In this age of complexity, the transition required is systemic and solutions need to be adaptable and holistic with a long-term vision. In response, UNDP has developed a shared agenda, a Regional Youth Project, SHABABEEK, to promote young people’s empowerment by building their capabilities and creating access to opportunities for engagement.Bringing together governments, private sector partners, civil society and young people, the Regional Youth Team works with 17 Country Offices in the Arab region, focusing on initiatives, projects and interventions directly supporting youth in the region under the two outcome areas of Economic, and Political and Civic Empowerment.As part of the project, a virtual space in the form of a digital platform, the NextGen Youth Platform, was created to bring together different elements of the youth innovation ecosystem.
